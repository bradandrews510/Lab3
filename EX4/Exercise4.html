    This is a story of long ago. At that time the
    languages and letters were quite different from
    ours of today. English is used to represent the
    languages. But two points may be noted. (1) In
    English the only correct plural of dwarf is dwarfs,
    and the adjective is dwarfish. In this story
    dwarves and dwarvish are used, but only when
    speaking of the ancient people to whom Thorin
    Oakenshield and his companions belonged. (2)
    Orc is not an English word. It occurs in one or
    two places but is usually translated goblin (or
    hobgoblin for the larger kinds). Orc is the
    hobbitsâ€™ form of the name given at that time to
    these creatures, and it is not connected at all
    with our orc, ork, applied to sea-animals of
    dolphin-kind.
